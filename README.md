# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA (TikTok)   
**IIT Guwahati Internship Project**

##  Project Overview
This project was developed during my internship at **IIT Guwahati**.  
The objective is to analyze TikTok account data and classify accounts based on behavioral and content-based features into different categories such as **Normal**, **RUS**, and **ROS**.

The project focuses on applying **data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques** to understand patterns and distinguish between different account behaviors.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze TikTok account datasets
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Extract meaningful features
- Classify accounts into different categories
- Compare behavior patterns across datasets

##  Datasets
- The datasets consist of TikTok account-related attributes
- Includes behavioral, engagement, and metadata features
- Data is used strictly for **academic and research purposes**

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

##  Methodology
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Model Training & Evaluation**
6. **Result Comparison**

---

##  Results
- Successfully identified distinguishable patterns among Normal, RUS, and ROS accounts
- Demonstrated how behavioral features can help classify TikTok accounts
- The analysis provides insights useful for **social media monitoring and security research**
